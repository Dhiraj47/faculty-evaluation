NOTE- UNIVERSITY LOGO HAS BEEN CHANGED...

‘IQAC Student’s Evaluation of Faculty’ is a dynamic web application for the online processing of data collected from students regarding the faculties’ performance in the individual courses they have taken and its visualization. To develop this application we have used web application tools like HTML and styling tools like CSS and BOOTSTRAP, front-end languages like JAVASCRIPT and CANVASJS for rendering Charts, back-end language like PHP and a database MySQL.

How to Run:
* install XAMPP
* create a database, named 'evaluation' (if not then change the DB name in ./db_connection.php file as your DB name)
* import table from ./db-files/evaluation.sql in that database

Thats all...Now you can run this application from localhost
